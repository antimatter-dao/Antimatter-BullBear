# Antimatter Overview
Antimatter = Dual Investment + Bull & Bear Tokens + Financial NFTs + Antimatter DAO + more
Antimatter is positioned to be the gateway for DeFi derivatives, including four main products now, including Dual Investment, Bull & Bear Tokens, Financial NFTs, as well as Antimatter DAO. 
## Product 1 - Dual Investment
Dual Invest offers a non-principal protected yield generating product. Enjoy high fixed yield no matter which direction the market goes.
It is an advanced options derivative based on a decentralised protocol. The product has a "market-neutral, returns guaranteed" feature, where the yield is clear and fixed at the time of purchase, while the settlement currency is uncertain. At maturity, the settlement currency depends on the outcome of the settlement price at maturity compared to the strike price.
## Product 2 - Bull & Bear Tokens
In its tokenized none-oracle perpetual options protocol, users can buy call and put options as an individual holder (buyer) or generate or redeem call and put options as one of the liquidity providers on  (Currently on testnet). They can also trade on-chain options for trading profits or to hedge their positions.
Understand Tokenized Perpetual Options in 1 minute
What Antimatter creates is decentralized Bull and Bear Tokens, which are leverage embedded and non-expiry. 
When the Underlying Asset price increases, the Bull Token price will increase more.
When the Underlying Asset price decreases, the Bear token price will decrease more. 
It is simple as it is, leveraged tokens. 
Bullish and want to have more price exposure? Buy Bull Token. Bearish and want to have some hedge? Buy Bear Token.
​
## Product 3 - Antimatter Financial NFTs
In its second product--Financial NFTs, Antimatter turns NFTs into vehicles and containers of assets to store them with different locking and releasing mechanisms, as well as to facilitate various financial activities.
Product 4 - Antimatter DAO
Antimatter DAO consists of three parts: Trading incentives, Antimatter Bond, and Matter token staking. The invisible value for MATTER is driven by community lovers and market sentiments, and the visible value is backed by transaction fees and Antimatter’s Bond system.
